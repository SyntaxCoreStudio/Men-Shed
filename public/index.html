            A welcoming space where men can share skills, enjoy company, and

            just having a chat, our shed is a place to belong.

          <h1 class="heading-wood">Our Goals</h1>
          <p>
            The Shed is a place where we come to enjoy each other's company —
            sometimes working together on a project, or maybe on our own. The
            main objectives are sharing life's journey, swapping ideas and
            concerns, and becoming involved in community and personal activities
            to further enhance our health and well being. There is a wide choice
            of activities on offer. That's because the Men's Shed movement is
            based on the belief that men communicate better shoulder to shoulder
            than face-to-face. It is not only the activities themselves that are
            important; it's the opportunities they create for our members to get
            to know each other better. You don't have to be an expert on
            anything to be in our Shed. That being said, we are self-managing
            and self-funding so we need to pool our skills to survive and grow
            as an organization.
          </p>

        <div class="section-text card">
          <h1 class="heading-wood">How do our member's benefit?</h1>
          <p>
            We believe that men can live longer, healthier, and happier lives
            by:
          </p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>
              enjoying the camaraderie of other men with similar interests
            </li>
            <li>applying our combined knowledge, experience and skills</li>
            <li>sharing stories</li>
            <li>mentoring others</li>
            <li>finding new opportunities and interests</li>
            <li>stimulating imaginations and offering new challenges</li>
            <li>rejuvenating spirits; and</li>
            <li>just having fun</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            New members are always welcome. The shed is open to men of all ages,
            backgrounds and abilities. The Shed has an ideal location at the
            heart of the Clem Jones Centre campus at Carina. So why don't you
            come along one day (09:00 on Wednesday morning is best) and see what
            you think. We are certain you will find it worthwhile.

          <h1 class="heading-wood">History of the Shed</h1>
          <p>
            The Carina Men’s Shed was started in 2009 in a garage under the
            house of our late founder Georgie Hickey, in Norcombe St, Carina. It
            was the fourth Men’s Shed to open in Queensland. Membership grew
            quickly and, within two years, with support from the Camp-Hill
            Carina Welfare Association and the State Government, the Shed
            relocated to a new, purpose-built structure on the Clem Jones Centre
            campus in Carina. Since then, the building has been extended and
            membership has grown to almost 180.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-text card">
          <h1 class="heading-wood">How the Shed operates</h1>
          <p>
            The Carina Men’s Shed is a member of the Queensland Men’s Shed
            Association, and the Australian Men’s Shed Association which now
            represents more than 1000 Sheds throughout Australia.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ours is a big Shed – with more than three times the membership level
            of the average Shed in Australia, so we need to have a significant
            level of organisation for the Shed to operate effectively. Under the
            Shed Constitution, the Shed has an Executive Committee, six
            management committees (Workshop Activities, Recreation Room
            Activities, Funding and Grants, Membership and Welfare, Marketing
            and Training) on which more than a dozen different Common Interest
            Groups and other activities are represented so both representation
            and responsibility are shared throughout the organisation.
          </p>

          <h1 class="heading-wood">Facilities</h1>
          <p>
            The building occupied in 2011 was a 150m2 workshop equipped for
            craft work in wood, metal and then glass. In 2013, with the
            availability of further funding, a large recreation room and office
            were added to the complex, allowing the variety of activities on
            offer to expand considerably.

        </div>
        <div class="section-text card">
          <h1 class="heading-wood">How the Shed is funded</h1>
          <p>
            Since its inception, the Carina Men’s Shed has received significant
            financial grants from government and other sources, and we continue
            to seek grants. However, while we appreciate the backing of our
            supporters, we aim to be as financially independent as possible,
            particularly in covering operating costs. To do this, funds are
            raised through annual membership fees and levies, selling our
            craftwork at fetes and other public events, and donations.
